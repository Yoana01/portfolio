      Hi, Iâ€™m Yoana Churkina â€“ a UX/UI designer and recent graduate of the Data-Driven Design masterâ€™s program at the University of Applied Studies Utrecht. Originally from Sofia, Bulgaria, Iâ€™ve spent the last five years in the Netherlands exploring how design, data, and technology come together to create meaningful digital experiences.

      My Approach
    </Typography>,
    <Typography paragraph key="approach-text">
      I believe UI design alone isnâ€™t enough. To make real impact, design must be grounded in a deep understanding of user behavior, needs, and values. I approach every project with a research-first mindset because only by knowing how people think and feel can we design experiences that truly resonate. I donâ€™t just design screens - I design interactions and behaviors that support both user needs and stakeholder goals.

    <Typography variant="subtitle1" paragraph color="text.secondary" key="approach-title">
      AI & Responsible Design
    </Typography>,
    <Typography paragraph key="ai-text">
      Studying AI made me even more aware of the importance of responsible design. As intelligent systems become part of everyday digital products, ethical considerations are essential. I use data to inform design, not control it, and strive to build trust through transparency and empathy.
    </Typography>,

    <Typography paragraph key="closing">
      Iâ€™m looking to join a team that values user-centered, socially responsible design, where I can keep growing, collaborating, and creating products that make a difference.
