      My Journey
    </Typography>,
    <Typography paragraph key="approach-text">
      During my master’s in Data-Driven Design, I learned that great design starts with understanding people. I’m passionate about uncovering the “why” behind user behavior, and I use research and data to guide decisions that make digital experiences both useful and meaningful.
