          This case study demonstrates the design and research process behind a
          personalized, data-driven financial management tool for students aged
          18â€“25. Through surveys, focus groups, expert interviews, storyboards,
          empathy mapping, and stakeholder analysis, key insights were
          uncovered: students often rely on family or DUO support, prefer Excel
          over finance apps, and experience stress when managing finances.

          Financial literacy is a crucial skill, yet many young adults struggle
          to manage their finances effectively due to limited knowledge.{" "}

            The research question - how can a personalized, data-driven
            financial management tool be designed to effectively support diverse
            student populations in improving their financial habits and
            engagement?

          the experience.

          The research showed clear similarities between the literature review and study results. Many students still rely on family or DUO support, motivating them to seek independence through part-time work. Interestingly, <b>70% preferred Excel</b> over financial apps for convenience.
        </Typography>
        <Typography paragraph>
          From the <b>banksâ€™ perspective</b>, younger users favor step-by-step short videos (e.g., Instagram reels) for learning. The participating bank also provides financial literacy lectures in high schools. Focus groups revealed that financial apps are often linked to <b>negative emotions</b> - stress, anxiety, and overwhelm. However, students were more open to apps if they were certified as secure and included educational video content.
        </Typography>
        <Typography paragraph>
          Future research should explore <b>financial avoidance</b> and how to shift studentsâ€™ mindset. The challenge is to design tools that promote literacy, motivate usage, and reduce stress.
        </Typography>
        <Typography paragraph>
          <b>In conclusion:</b> The target audience experiences financial anxiety and lacks confidence in their knowledge. The app should act as a <b>learning space</b> to build <b>confidence in financial skills</b>, while motivating users to track expenses and reduce spending.
